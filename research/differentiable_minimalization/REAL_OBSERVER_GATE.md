# Real observer runtime gate

This directory is research-only. It must not modify Minimalizer production requirements.

## Reuse before install

Minimalizer already validated an isolated RTX 5060 semantic observer environment in Calibration 06 Phase E:
Python 3.11.9, Torch 2.11 CUDA 12.8, Transformers 5.17, Grounding-DINO tiny + SAM ViT-B. Reuse cached model assets/environment when present rather than duplicating the ~4.47 GB environment.

## Required real evidence

P5 adoption remains HOLD until Diagnostic-2 (Hyakuto Kyoko / Raden) has:
1. real frozen semantic features from a pretrained observer;
2. real semantic-region masks from an analysis-only segmentation observer;
3. baseline and refined renders bound to the same source;
4. deterministic repeat;
5. machine A/B result plus mandatory human visual QA.

Synthetic/injected test observations never count as corpus evidence.
